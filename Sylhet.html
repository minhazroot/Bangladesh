        Sylhet Division (Bengali: সিলেট বিভাগ) is the northeastern division of Bangladesh. It is bordered by the Indian
        states of Meghalaya, Assam and Tripura to the north, east and south respectively, and by the Bangladeshi
        divisions of Chittagong to the southwest and Dhaka and Mymensingh to the west. Prior to 1947, it included the
        subdivision of Karimganj (presently in Barak Valley, India). However, Karimganj (including the thanas of
        Badarpur, Patharkandi and Ratabari) was inexplicably severed from Sylhet by the Radcliffe Boundary Commission.
        According to Niharranjan Ray, it was partly due to a plea from a delegation led by Abdul Matlib Mazumdar.[9]

    <h3>Etymology and names</h3>
    <p>
        The name Sylhet is an anglicisation of Shilhot (শিলহট). Its origins seem to come from the Sanskrit words শিলা
        śilā (meaning 'stone') and হট্ট haṭṭa (meaning 'marketplace'). These words match the landscape and topography of
        the hilly region. The shila stones were abundant across Sylhet and King Gour Govinda is known to have used
        stones to guard his capital. The word changed to Shilhot due to the elision of letter-final অ ô in the Bengali
        language.[10] Another theory is that it was named after Princess Sheela, the eldest daughter of Raja Guhak of
        the Jaintia Kingdom. It is said that Sheela was once bathing in a pond and was kidnapped. After being rescued by
        her father Raja Guhak, Sheela started to become more religious and live a secluded life. Sheela's died at a
        young age, the port-area which developed around the lake, which was the largest centre in northeastern Bengal
        for trade, was named Sheela haat (or Sheela's marketplace) in her honour. Xuanzang of China mentions that he
        visited a place called Sheelachatal in the 630s in his book, the Great Tang Records on the Western Regions. The
        Hattanath Tales mention Sheelachatal was named after both daughters of Guhak; Sheela and Chatala. Chatala
        indulged herself in an unlawful relationship with one of the palace servants, leading to her being disowned and
        dumped in a distant island in the middle of 2000 square mile lake to the south of the kingdom.[11]

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        In 1874, the current Sylhet Division, which included Karimganj District, was entirely known as the 'Sylhet
        district'. On 16 February 1874, Sylhet was separated from mainland Bengal to be made a part of the
        non-regulation Chief Commissioner's Province of Assam (Northeast Frontier Province) in order to facilitate
        Assam's commercial development.[18][19] The people of Sylhet submitted a memorandum to the Viceroy protesting
        the inclusion in Assam.[20] The protests subsided when the Viceroy, Lord Northbrook, visited Sylhet to reassure
        the people that education and justice would be administered from Bengal,[21] and when the people in Sylhet saw
        the opportunity of employment in tea estates in Assam and a market for their produce.[22] In 1905, Sylhet
        district rejoined Bengal as a part of the new Surma Valley Division of Eastern Bengal and Assam. In 1912, the
        then Sylhet district was once again moved to the newly created Assam Province alongside the other districts of
        the Surma Valley Division.
