    <!-- about start -->
    <p>
        <strong> Rajshahi Division</strong> (Bengali: রাজশাহী বিভাগ) is one of the eight first-level administrative
        divisions of
        Bangladesh. It has an area of 18,174.4 square kilometres (7,017.2 sq mi)[3] and a population at the 2011 Census
        of 18,484,858.[4] Rajshahi Division consists of 8 districts, 70 Upazilas (the next lower administrative tier)
        and 1,092 Unions (the lowest administrative tier).

        The region has historically been dominated by various feudal Rajas, Maharajas and Zamindars.[5] Formerly
        comprising 16 districts, a new division (Rangpur Division) was formed with the 8 northern districts of the old
        Rajshahi Division from early 2010.[3]
    </p>
    <h3>Etymology and names</h3>
    <p>The Rajshahi Division is named after Rajshahi District. Dominated by various feudal Rajas, Maharajas and
        Zamindars of mixed origins throughout history,[5] the name is a compound of the words Raj and Shahi, both of
        which can be translated into reign or kingdom. Archaic spellings in the English language also included Rajeshae.
        The capital city of the division was formerly known as Rampur Boalia but was later renamed to Rajshahi too, to
        match the name of the district.
    </p>
    <h3>Agriculture</h3>
    <p>
        Rajshahi is well known for its fruit, particularly for mango and lichi. Rajshahi also produces a lot of crops
        and vegetables like potato, carrot, rice, onion, wheat, sugarcane, pulses, spices, banana etc. Naogaon is known
        as the storehouse of food of Bangladesh.
