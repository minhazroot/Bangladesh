    <section class="about">
        <p><strong> Chittagong Division,</strong> officially known as Chattogram Division, is geographically the largest
            of the eight
            administrative divisions of Bangladesh. It covers the south-easternmost areas of the country, with a total
            area of 33,909.00 km2 (13,092.34 sq mi)[3] and a population at the 2011 census of 28,423,019. The
            administrative division includes mainland Chittagong District, neighbouring districts and the Chittagong
            Hill Tracts.

            Chittagong Division is home to Cox's Bazar, the longest natural sea beach in the world;[4][5] as well as St.
            Martin's Island, Bangladesh's sole coral reef.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The Chittagong Division was established in 1829 to serve as an administrative headquarters for five of
            Bengal's easternmost districts, with the Chittagong District serving as its headquarters.[6] During the East
            Pakistan period, the division's Tippera district was renamed to Comilla District in 1960.

            In 1984, fifteen districts were created by separating and reducing the original five districts of
            Chittagong, Comilla, Hill Tracts, Noakhali and Sylhet:

            The Chittagong District was divided into two districts; Chittagong and Cox's Bazar District
            The Cumilla District was split into three districts; Cumilla, Brahmanbaria and Chandpur
            The Hill Tracts District was split into three districts; Bandarban, Khagrachhari and Rangamati
            The Noakhali District was divided into three districts; Noakhali, Lakshmipur and Feni
            The Sylhet District was split into four districts; Sylhet, Habiganj, Moulvibazar and Sunamganj.
            Sylhet, Habiganj, Moulvibazar and Sunamganj district ceded from the Chittagong Division to join a
            newly-established Sylhet Division in 1995.
